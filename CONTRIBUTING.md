# Contributing

## Feature requests or improvements

- Feature requests should be a small addition to the platform and not change other features.
- Improvements or enhancements should change features and not add anything to the platform.
- Feature requests or improvements should be well-documented and include a clear description of the change and how it benefits the platform.

## Finding a Bug

- Do not create a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability, instead refer to our [Security Vulnerability Reporting Form](https://forms.gle/ZVefbwJP6zqQeGf28).
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on the repository issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description and as much relevant information as possible.

## Fixing a Bug

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Before submitting, please read the Pull Request Guidelines below.

### Pull Requests

If you want to create a new PR, it should follow these rules:

- One Feature/Fix per Pull Request: Keep pull requests focused on a single feature, bug fix, or improvement. This makes it easier to review and understand the changes.
- Keep Pull Requests Small: Aim for smaller, more manageable pull requests. This makes them easier to review and reduces the likelihood of conflicts.
- Clear and Concise Title: Use a descriptive title that summarizes the changes made in the pull request.
- Detailed Description: Provide a comprehensive description of the changes made, the motivation behind them, and any relevant context. Include screenshots if applicable, especially for visual changes.
- Reference Related Issues: If the pull request addresses an existing issue, reference it in the description.
- Follow Coding Style: Adhere to the established coding style guidelines for the project. This ensures consistency and readability across the codebase.
- Write Tests: Include appropriate unit or integration tests for the code changes. This helps to prevent regressions and ensure the code works as expected.
