# Ouzox
A platform for game developers that want to make the most out of their games. It's a platform that knows developers deserve more than what they're given. As a developer, you're in charge. You set the price, design the page, and watch the money flow in.
Why create on our platform?
1. Free to publish: Ouzox is a free platform to publish games on. There are no upfront costs or fees, so you can get your game out there without having to worry about any financial barriers.
2. No gatekeepers: Ouzox is a platform that's open to all developers, regardless of their experience or skill level. There is no need to go through a long approval process, so you can get your game up and running quickly.
3. 85% revenue split: Ouzox offers an 85/15 revenue split, which means that game developers keep 85% of the money they earn from their games. This is a higher percentage than many other platforms, which typically offer a 70/30 or 50/50 split.
4. Creator-friendly policies: Ouzox is creator-friendly. The platform is more lenient on what you can or can't upload. This means you can be just a bit riskier with what you create here.
