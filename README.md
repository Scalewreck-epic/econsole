### Pull Requests

If you want to create a pull request, it should follow these rules:

- One Feature/Fix per Pull Request: Keep pull requests focused on a single feature, bug fix, or improvement. This makes it easier to review and understand the changes.
- Keep Pull Requests Small: Aim for smaller, more manageable pull requests. This makes them easier to review and reduces the likelihood of conflicts.
- Clear and Concise Title: Use a descriptive title that summarizes the changes made in the pull request.
- Detailed Description: Provide a comprehensive description of the changes made, the motivation behind them, and any relevant context. Include screenshots if applicable, especially for visual changes.
- Reference Related Issues: If the pull request addresses an existing issue, reference it in the description.
- Follow Coding Style: Adhere to the established coding style guidelines for the project. This ensures consistency and readability across the codebase.
- Write Tests: Include appropriate unit or integration tests for the code changes. This helps to prevent regressions and ensure the code works as expected.
